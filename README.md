3D Solar System Simulation – Project Description

This project is a 3D simulation of the Solar System built using Three.js. It displays the Sun and all 8 planets with realistic textures and animations. Each planet revolves around the Sun in its own orbit, and the user can control the speed of each planet using sliders. The system also includes Pause and Resume buttons for control.
