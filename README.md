# 🌍 3D Solar System Simulation (Three.js)

A fully interactive 3D simulation of the Solar System, developed using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project visualizes the Sun and all 8 planets with realistic textures, orbit animations, background stars, and user controls.

## 📦 How to Run the Project Locally

> ⚠️ **Do NOT open `index.html` directly.**  
> You must use a local server, or textures will fail to load due to CORS restrictions.

### ✅ Run with Live Server (VS Code)

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the folder in **Visual Studio Code**.
3. Install the **Live Server** extension (if not already installed).
4. Right-click `index.html` → click **“Open with Live Server”**.
5. The simulation will open at: http://localhost:5500/


You should now see a 3D animated Solar System in your browser!
